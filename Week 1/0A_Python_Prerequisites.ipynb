    "Python, first released in 1991, is a programming language of increasing popularity and the one that shall be used throughout this course. \n",
    "Later, you'll learn about a framework called PyTorch, which allows us to easily implement neural networks in Python. \n",
    "In addition to this practical consideration, Python boasts such benefits as code-readability, easy semantics,  interactivity (i.e., you don't have to recompile all the time!), and it supports such common programming paradigms as object-oriented and functional programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "This walk-through provides an overview of aspects of the Python programming language you'll need to know for the course, including: lists, tuples, dictionaries, for-loops, if-statements, NumPy, and MatPlotLib. \n",
    "We recommend that you are comfortable with all of these before proceeding with the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "For those unfamiliar with Python, this will likely not be sufficient to bring you fully up-to-speed. \n",
    "Instead, the free e-book [Python Like You Mean It](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/intro.html), by Ryan Soklaski, will provide an more comprehensive introduction to Python for scientific computing. \n",
    "Additionally, to further learn about the programming language's features and to view its documentation, the website <http://www.python.org> is a great resource. "
